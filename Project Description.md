Air pollution is a major environmental and health concern in many parts of the world, and there is a growing need for reliable and cost-effective air quality monitoring systems. In this study, we present a low-cost air quality monitoring system that uses a NodeMCU microcontroller, an MQ135 gas sensor, and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to measure and record air pollution levels. The system is also integrated with the Blynk platform, which allows remote access and control of the system using a mobile application.

The system is designed to be compact and portable, allowing it to be easily deployed in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. The MQ135 sensor is used to detect the presence of several harmful gases, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ammonia, while the DHT11 sensor is used to measure temperature and humidity levels. The NodeMCU microcontroller is used to collect data from the sensors, store it in a database, and transmit it to the Blynk platform for visualization and analysis.

We tested the system in a variety of settings, including a home environment and an outdoor urban environment, and found that it was able to provide accurate and reliable air quality measurements. The integration with the Blynk platform allows for real-time monitoring and remote control of the system, making it ideal for applications where monitoring data needs to be available in real-time.

Overall, the system presented in this study represents a low-cost and effective approach to air quality monitoring, with the added benefit of remote monitoring and control through the Blynk platform. This system has the potential to be deployed in a range of settings to improve our understanding of air pollution and its impacts on human health and the environment.
